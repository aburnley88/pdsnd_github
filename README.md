## About

U.S. Bikeshare data is a project from the Udacity Nanodegree program _Python for Data Science_.
It is a console application written in python using the numpy and pandas to explore bikeshare data from
the following cities:

1. New York City
2. Chicago
3. Washington D.C.

## Start Up
Users of this application would need to request copies of the data which are in csv format.
Once they have the files open up a terminal, navigate to the appropriate folder, and run: 

`python bikeshare.py`

## Architechure
There are 4 scripts associated with this application:

1. bikeshare.py
2. welcome.py
3. helpers.py
4. stats.py 

bikeshare.py is the start up script with the sole purpose of starting the application. Welcome.py gathers
and validates user input that is used to fetch and filter the data for the user. Helpers.py contains methods
to assist welcome.py. Stats.py does all the statistical calculations.

## Future Plans
If time allows I would like to learn flask or another frontend framework for python to turn this into a 
web app, but for now, what you see is what you get!ðŸ˜Š
